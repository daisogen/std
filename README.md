# DEPRECATION NOTICE

This repository, `std`, has been deprecated in favor of the complete Rust compilation toolchain that you can find in [the `toolchain` repository](https://github.com/daisogen/toolchain). It not only contains the target (`x86_64-unknown-daisogen`) description, but it also implements an `std` crate with the official API, compatible with regular OS implementations, which makes a lot of Rust programs directly compatible.
